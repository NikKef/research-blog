# Nikolas Kefalonitis — Research Blog

Welcome to my personal research blog and academic portfolio.  
I'm an 18-year-old aspiring researcher exploring the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence**, **Blockchain**, **Quantitative Finance**, and **Sustainability Tech**.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) using the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme and hosted freely on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## 🌱 Purpose

- To document my learning and progress in technical domains
- To publish small-scale research, experiments, and literature reviews
- To build a public academic presence and portfolio

## 📂 Structure

- `/blog`: Technical blog posts and research reflections
- `/projects`: Experiments, code, and mini research applications
- `/papers`: Full research-style writeups (PDFs or LaTeX-rendered)
- `_posts/`: Jekyll-powered Markdown files for blog entries

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Jekyll + Markdown
- GitHub Pages
- LaTeX (for math)
- Git for version control
